## Semantic Tracing
- `Seg Camera Nums`: The number of camera views that we perform semantic unprojection. It controls the number of times that we query [SAM](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything). Reducing this number speeds up semantic tracing. However, if you notice inaccuracies in your mask, consider increasing this value for better results.
